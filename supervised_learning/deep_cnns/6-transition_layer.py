    Builds a transition layer by implementing compression as used in

    All weights should use he normal initialization. The seed for the he_normal
    initializer should be set to zero.
    All convolutions should be preceded by Batch Normalization and a rectified
    linear activation (ReLU).

    Args:

        nb_filters (int): The number of filters in the input (X).
