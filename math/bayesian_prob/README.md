## Introduction

Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief.

## Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory which describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It is named after Thomas Bayes.

The formula is given by:

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that B is true.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring given that A is true.
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B, respectively.


## Applications

Bayesian probability has been used in a wide range of applications, including:
- Spam filtering
- Medical diagnosis
- Weather forecasting
- Risk assessment
- A/B testing
- Machine learning
- And many more
